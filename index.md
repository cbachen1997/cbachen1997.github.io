## Research Interests

- Deep Learning for Remote Sensing
- Graph Neural Network
- Brain-inspired Algorithms

My current research focuses on the on-orbit rapid detection of earth's surface anomalies (e.g. natural disaster, man-made accident), primarily utilizing **graph neural network (GNN)** techniques. I design models that take into account the nature of remote sensing imagery to rapidly detect and diagnose earth's surface anomalies from single remote sensing images.
